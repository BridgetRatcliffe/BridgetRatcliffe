Hi, I’m @BridgetRatcliffe. I am currently a graduate student at Columbia University, working at the intersection of Astrophysics and Satistics. I am interested in using the observable chemistry of stars to learn more about stellar birth properties and Milky Way evolution. You can reach me at blr2147 at columbia.edu
